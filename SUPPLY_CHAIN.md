# Software Supply Chain

DPN Technology preserves release traceability with repository-local automation.

Each supported release should include the source archive, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `RELEASE_MANIFEST.txt`, an SPDX 2.3 `SBOM.spdx.json`, `SOURCE_SHA256SUMS.txt`, and `DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.txt`.

The inventory discovers declared dependencies from Python requirements files, Node package manifests, Gradle/Maven coordinates, Docker base images, and GitHub Actions references. Runtime plugins, system packages, externally installed models, and infrastructure not declared in the repository may require separate operational inventory.

Verify tracked source with `sha256sum -c SOURCE_SHA256SUMS.txt` and release artifacts with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Never overwrite an existing version tag with different source, and never include production credentials, databases, backups, private logs, or private operational exports in release assets.
